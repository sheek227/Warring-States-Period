The beginning of this chinese cultural sequence was known as the Three Soverigns and Five Emperors period. This cultural period is prehistoric, or pre-written records, and it is not very well-known. However, several important cultures (e.g., Longshan, Yangshao, Dawenkou, etc.) lived during this period that dates to c.3162 BCE to 2070 BCE. This period saw the development of several types of artifacts, the main one being pottery.</p>

                    <p class="no-margin">During this period, we see several different types of innovation. Some of these innovations are cultural like the use of turtle shells or ox bones as a form of divinition during the Shang Dynasty (1600 - 1050 BCE). These are known as oracle bones.</p>

These innovations included writing, architecture, silk, jade, but probably the most abundant example of innovation comes from bronze.

The Zhou believed that those chosen by the Mandate of Heaven were the representives of the supreme god Shangdi on earth. As long as things were going well in the kingdom, that ruler enjoyed the highest amount of respect, but if things were going poorly it was taken as a sign by the heavens that it was time for a change.</p>

                <p class="vert-center"> Now that we have some context about the region and the time period, let's dive into the Warring States Period. The Warring States period was the end product of several negative factors coming together. It started after the fall of the Western Zhou capital city, Haojing, which forced the Zhou kings to establish a new capital to the east called Luoyang. This is known as the Eastern Zhou period (c. 771 - 221 BCE), which is divided into two major phases: the Spring and Autumn period (c. 770 - 476 BCE) and the Warring States Period (c. 475 - 221 BCE). The Spring and Autumn period is associated with the decline of Zhou kings' authority over the central plains.</p>
